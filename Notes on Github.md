**Some fundamentals of Github**

- Github is useful for working on programming projects because it lets you edit and collborate in an organized, methodical manner.

- Repositories are like folders for code and files. If you are working on a big project, give it a repository!
  - Within a repository, we can do Github Stuff!
  -We can create files
    - Usually, the best way to make changes to some code is to create a branch of a file, then make your changes, and then create a pull request to the master branch (or other desired location) so that other people and yourself can step back and mkae sure these are the changes you want and so you can keep track of the changes.
    - When you make changes with pull requests and commits, always use commit comments and titles to keep track of your work and to make it easy to follow for others.
 
- The Github desktop app is great to use! Use it for uploading files from your text editor to Github!
  - You can copy and transfer stiff back and from between the Github online and desktop app
  
-Markdown language is the formatting and style of text in Github! It is what I am using right now to make these notes with the bullet points and bolded words. 

There is a ton of features and things to explore on Github! The inner workings of it are an enigma! Best way to become a Github virtuoso is to just jump in and start Gitting!
